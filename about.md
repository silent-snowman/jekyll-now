### Who I Am
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm avid software engineer who loves to make things that make people's lives easier. I grew up on a small family farm where I learned to take things apart, break things, fix things and then try to figure out how to put them back together usually in that order. I learned to weld, braze, lathe, torch and do a lot of different things to make and fix various equipment made of metal. This is what started my passion for creating things. <br />

### Why I love Software
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so excited when I first discovered software because essentially everything starts out as virtual and conceptual. This means that your mistakes while prototyping don't usually have immediate physical consequences. Since you aren't breaking physical things that are often hard to fix, you can learn faster and more importantly build faster. If you've ever worked with sheet metal and a manual brake press you'd understand just how important and annoying precision can be while prototyping even the simplest of concepts. Obviously, if you are prototyping firmware then you can and often will have immediate physical consequences. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next best thing about software is that once you have created and perfected your software to handle all the edges cases you can imagine, you can deploy it (sometimes almost instantly) to a massive number of people hopefully optimizing a part of their lives so they can focus on more meaningful aspects of their lives like spending time with family. <br />
