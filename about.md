&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm avid software engineer who loves to make things that help make people's lives easier. I grew up on a small family farm where I learned to take things apart, break things and then try to figure out how to put them back together usually in that order. I learned to weld, braze, lathe, torch and do a lot of different things to make and fix various parts made of metal. This is what started my passion for creating things. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so excited when I first discovered software because essentially everything starts out as virtual and conceptual so your mistakes while prototyping don't usually have immediate physical consequences thus you can learn faster and more importantly create things faster. If you've ever worked with sheet metal and a metal press you'd understand just how important and annoying precision can be while prototyping even the simplest of items. Obviously, if prototyping firmware than you can and often will have immediate physical consequences. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next best thing about software is that once you have created and perfected your software to handle all the edges cases you can imagine, you can deploy it (sometimes almost instantly) to a massive number of people hopefully optimizing a part of their lives so they can focus on more meaningful aspects of their lives like spending time with family. <br />
